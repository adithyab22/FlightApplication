 Use Cases:
<table style="width:100%">
<tr>
<td>
<b> 1. For a particular SUCCESS_ID, we need to be able to retrieve, the total fees that the user paid as part of airline card fees for all flights </b> <br>  
SELECT total_fee FROM sales WHERE success_id = ?;
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b> 2.  For a particular SUCCESS_ID, we need to be able to retrieve, the card type used to complete booking </b> <br> 
SELECT card_type FROM sales WHERE success_id  = ?;
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3.
  <b> For a particular SUCCESS_ID, we need to be able to retrieve, the fee range for all flights. This means we need the minimum and maximum of all flights. </b>  <br> 
  SELECT MIN(b.flight_price), MAX(b.flight_price) FROM sales  a  INNER JOIN  cart  b ON  a.cart_id  = b.cart_id  WHERE  a.success_id  = ?;
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b> 4. For Q3, can the range also pass the card type associated with it? </b> <br>
SELECT a.card_type, MINb.price),  MAX(b.price)  FROM sales  a  INNER JOIN cart b ON a.cart_id = b.cart_id  WHERE  a.success_id  =  ? GROUP  BY a.card_type;
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b> 5. We need to be able to find out the total number of bookings that were done with a particular card type. So, say the total bookings done by a VISA credit card </b> <br> 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE card_type = 'VISA';
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>6. An analyst,
  wants in real time to see the number of attempts that the user made while
  entering different credit cards. Can there be any logging associated that can
  help the analyst? </b> <br>

  SELECT
  a.* FROM sales a INNER
  JOIN
  cart b ON a.cart_id = b.cart_id WHERE a.success_idÂ  = ?;
